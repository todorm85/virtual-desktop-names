# virtual-desktop-names
A tool for naming windows 10 built-in virtual desktops

# usage
For best experience the "Disable showing baloon notifications as toast" setting in group "policy>>user configurations>>administrative templates>>start menu and taskbar" must be enabled. Computer must be restarted after enabling this setting.

# functionality
Saves names for the native win 10 virtual desktops.
Runs with an empty icon in the system tray. When clicked shows current saved desktop name or the default if not set. It also shows desktop names when switched as baloon notification.
